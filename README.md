# beetus

__beetus is your foe.__

## Wait... what?

All jokes aside, `beetus` is a 2D platformer game (built using the minimalistic `pyxel` game engine).

In `beetus`, the foes you face are procedurally controlled by simulated blood glucose time series data (or __real CGM data__ if you have a CGM).
